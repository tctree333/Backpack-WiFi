# Files
*"backpack_wifi"* is a simplified version with basic css. Within the folder, *"backpack_wifi.ino"* is what you flash to your ESP8266. *"index.h"* is the HTML code for the web interface.

The *"backpack_wifi_fancy"* folder is functionally the same as the normal *"backpack_wifi"* but with fancy CSS animations done by my friend Jad.

# To use
Clone the repository to your computer. Open the folder of your choice with the Arduino IDE. Upload to your ESP8266.

Wire your ESP8266 as shown:
